# Action

## Endpoints

An action can make one or more requests to various endpoints. Because the framework handles the authentication side of a request, you will not have to worry about that here.

The most important thing is to identify which endpoint will address the purpose of the action. Here we will take a look at Close.io's Lead object and how to retrieve it via the API.

![close.io get lead object image](/assets/images/closeio-doc.png)

```ruby
actions: {

  get_lead_by_id: {

    input_fields: lambda do
      [
        { name: "lead_id", optional: false }
      ]
    end,

    execute: lambda do |connection, input|
      get("https://app.close.io/api/v1/lead/#{input["lead_id"]}/")
    end,

    output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|
      object_definitions["lead"]
    end
  }
}
```

A very simple action looks like this. A get request to the Close.io leads endpoint. In this case, the particular leadâ€™s details is appended in the endpoint.

## Body

Other endpoints require parameters to access certain details, instead of accessing a particular resource route.

A GET request can have parameters added to the request like so:

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  {
    'companies': get("https://#{connection['deployment']}.api.accelo.com/api/v0/companies.json").
                 params(_search: input["company_name"])["response"]
  }
end
```

A POST or PUT or PATCH request can have payloads attached as well. There are 2 ways you can do this.

Add payloads to the method

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  {
    "users": get("https://#{connection['helpdesk']}.freshdesk.com/api/users.json", input)["results"]
  }
end
```

Add payloads using the payload method

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  post("https://api.pushbullet.com/v2/pushes").
    payload(
      email: input["email"],
      title: input["title"]
      body: input["body"]
    )
end
```

See [Methods](/developing-connectors/sdk/methods.md) section for list of methods available for use in your custom connector actions.

### Output

Did you notice that some requests were encapsulated in `{ }`, and some were not? This will depend on what your endpoint returns and how you would like to map the response to your `output_fields`. Typically, most REST endpoints would return a JSON response, whether the request was successful or not.

Here are two examples. In all cases, the SDK expects the last line of the execute block to be a Hash object.

Assume that the output from an example endpoint is as so

```json
{
  "email": "j@a.co"
}
```

#### Simple object output

Here, we can leave the `GET` method alone, since it maps directly into our `output_fields` definition.

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  get("https://api.example.com/v1/email")
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  [
    { name: "email" }
  ]
end
```

#### Nested object output

Here we need to take the extra step of mapping the response returned as a nested Hash object.

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  response = get("https://api.example.com/v1/email")

  { user: response }
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  [
    {
      name: "user",
      type: :object,
      properties: [
        { name: "email" }
      ]
    }
  ]
end
```

or

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  {
    user: get("https://api.example.com/v1/email")
  }
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  [
    {
      name: "user",
      type: :object,
      properties: [
        { name: "email" }
      ]
    }
  ]
end
```

Do also take precautions if the endpoint returns a non-JSON response, e.g. `"j@a.co"`. If you do not encapsulate these into a final Hash object, you may get this commonly seen error:

```
undefined method `to_hash` for "j@a.co":String
Did you mean? to_s
```

Use the method `response_format_raw` in these cases

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  response = get("https://api.example.com/v1/email").
    response_format_raw

    { email: response }
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  [
    { name: "email" }
  ]
end
```

#### Array output

##### Top-level array responses

Some endpoints return a simple top-level array response:

```json
[
  "elijah@a.co",
  "marion@a.co",
  "shayna@a.co"
]
```

We would simply need to nest the object like in the previous example

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  response = get("https://api.example.com/v1/emails")

    { emails: response }
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  [
    {
      name: "emails",
      type: :array,
      of: :string
    }
  ]
end
```

##### Nested array responses

Now let's assume that the output from an example endpoint is as so

```json
{
  "child_emails": [
    "elijah@a.co",
    "marion@a.co",
    "shayna@a.co"
  ]
}
```

We can directly map the response in `output_fields` without having to nest it.

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  get("https://api.example.com/v1/child_emails")
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  [
    {
      name: "child_emails",
      type: :array,
      of: :string
    }
  ]
end
```

Note that we define an array of name `child_emails` in our `output_fields`. This matches the response array's name. If you intend to use different names, you must use nest the response output in the `execute` block.

For example, we want the output array to have name `emails` instead of `child_emails`. Let's use Ruby method `dig` to surface the desired array to the top-level.

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  response = get("https://api.example.com/v1/child_emails").
               dig["child_emails"]
               # ["elijah@a.co","marion@a.co","shayna@a.co"]

  { emails: response }
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  [
    {
      name: "emails",
      type: :array,
      of: :string
    }
  ]
end
```

##### Responses with arrays of objects

Here we have an array of objects as our response. This is more commonly seen.

```json
{
  "children": [
    {
      "child_name": "Elijah",
      "child_age": 3
    },
    {
      "child_name": "Marion",
      "child_age": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's use a predefined object in `object_definitions`, which is similar to the nomenclature used in the response.

```ruby
object_definitions: {
  children: {
    fields: lambda do
      [
        {
          name: "children",
          type: :array,
          of: :object,
          properties: [
            { name: "child_name" },
            { name: "child_age", type: :integer }
          ]
        }
      ]
  }
}
```

With this, we can simply perform the mapping in the following way

```ruby
execute: lambda do |connection, input|
  get("https://api.example.com/v1/children")
end,

output_fields: lambda do
  object_definitions["children"]
end
```
