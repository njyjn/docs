# Troubleshooting
In this section, we cover common recipe design errors (design-time errors) and recipe job errors (execution errors), as well as recipe logic errors. This section also covers trigger errors and action errors, and the common error codes you might come across in working with recipes. There are also recommended steps for resolving and preventing these errors to build a more robust recipe.
