# Single Sign-On (SSO)
Single sign-on allows users to use a single set of credentials (e.g. username and password) to login to multiple applications. This can simplify password management and provide additional security if 2 factor authentication is set up for the identity management app.

Workato supports single sign-on with Google, Salesforce, Slack, Intuit and Infusionsoft. This means that users can create a Workato account and sign in via their Google, Salesforce, Slack, Intuit or Infusionsoft usernames and passwords.
