# What is Workato?
Workato is an integration platform that connects cloud applications and on-premise applications. This platform combines an enterprise-grade integration platform with the ease of use associated with consumer applications. This enables users to easily build, deploy and manage complex app integrations.

# Why Workato?

## The integration problem
Most businesses have multiple applications in use that handle operational data. These frequently include both cloud-based and on-premise applications. In addition, personal and business productivity applications such as chat, social media, calendering, and the like are a key part of daily work and data from these is often unintegrated with other business data.

Without automated integration, organizations cannot leverage the full power of data in their multiple applications, re-enter data multiple times across applications, constantly context-switch across applications to accomplish tasks, and so on.

## The challenges of integration
Automated integration solves the problem of data siloes. But if you are going to automate transactions that span applications, then these processes must be reliable, secure, and manageable. Business and IT users need visibility into the running integrations and the capability to take appropriate action if an error or exception occurs.

A viable integration solution must be able to handle the complexities of real-world problems. Real-world integration problems often require more than just transporting single data objects across applications. They may require multi-step processes with business logic, workflow capabilities, one-to-many or many-to-one data mappings, and other such challenges. Too, many applications typically are customized for a particular business, and integrations must handle these customizations, since they are a part of the organization’s business processes.

Some of the issues we see with integration solutions today:

- Integration platform products are relatively high cost, sometimes costing more than the applications being connected

- Powerful integration products are oriented toward technical users, while citizen integrator products sacrifice capability for usability

- Citizen integrator products need to be enterprise-grade in terms of reliability, scalability and security

- Adding new, complex integrations can involve long implementation times spanning months, while new apps are coming online much faster than that

- IT needs visibility into the integration processes. Where necessary, it should be possible for IT and business users to collaborate to create and manage integration solutions.

Workato addresses these issues with an enterprise-class integration tool that can be governed and monitored by IT, but with the ease of use and low barrier to entry expected from modern cloud applications.

# How is Workato different from other integration platforms?

## Enterprise-Grade Foundation - the Workato Automation Platform
The Workato platform has a powerful feature set to handle real-world problems, including the integration of applications, data and people. Both cloud-based and on-premise systems are supported. The runtime system is designed for security, robustness, reliability and high performance.

## Self-Service User Interface
Workato’s user interface is designed to be easy to use for non-technical users and enables rapid deployment of integration solutions. At the same time, it enables users with more technical and application expertise to deeply extend and customize the platform.

## Conversational Integration with Apps
Workbots enable control of, and notifications from, business applications from within personal productivity apps, on both mobile and desktop devices. Workbots build a bridge between Systems of Engagement (SoE) and Systems of Reference (SoR) for business users.

## Self-Service and IT Governance
Workato Aegis is a management tool that provides cross-enterprise visibility into deployed integration processes and the applications they connect. Workato Aegis supports assigning differing levels of responsibility and visibility within the platform, and enables collaboration between business and IT users. It enables implementation and enforcement of policies to improve security and governance across all Workato users within an enterprise.

## Extensible Automation
Workato’s platform is extensible to add support for new applications beyond the many that are available pre-built. A powerful and configurable REST data connector allows integration to many systems without writing of code. Workato also provides a Connector SDK that handles and abstracts multiple aspects of application and data integration for cases where custom development is required. Existing connectors can be extended via the SDK or via adding functions from the REST connector. In addition, a public API allows control of recipes from third-party applications.
