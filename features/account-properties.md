# Account properties
Account-level properties are also known as environment variables or configuration variables. They show up in all recipes as usable values under the *Properties* datatree. Acccount properties are useful for complex deployment models across connections and recipes.

Account properties feature is enabled only for certain plans. Check the [Pricing and Plans page](https://www.workato.com/pricing?audience=general) or reach out to Workato sales representatives at +1 (844) 469-6752 to find out more.

For Workato accounts with account properties feature, users are able to view the account properties option on their account menu.
