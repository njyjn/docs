# Secondary connectors
When you are building a recipe, you will notice that you can only connect one instance of your app. Howeverm there are some instances where you may have to move data from one instance of an app to another. For example, you may want to move all your leads from one salesforce instance to another. In order to do so, you will need to use a **Secondary Connector**

Currently, Workato offers the following secondary connectors
* JIRA Secondary
* QuickBase Secondary
* Salesforce Secondary
* ServiceNow Secondary
* Slack Secondary

To use a secondary connector, simply build a recipe and look for the secondary connectors when created a new action. You will be able to use all the features of a primary connector, just that the tasks will be performed in the instance used to make the secondary connection. 

**Note**: using a secondary connector counts as a serparate connection.
