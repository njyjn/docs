# SurveyMonkey
[SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) is a widely used online forms and survey software that allows users to easily design and send surveys and forms, as well as analyze the results.

## API version
The SurveyMonkey connector uses [SurveyMonkey REST API V3](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/api/v3/#getting-started).

## Supported editions and versions
The SurveyMonkey connector works with all SurveyMonkey plans. However, the [**Extract data** capability](https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/details/) is required to retrieve survey responses from SurveyMonkey, i.e. using the **Completed survey response** trigger or the **Send survey invite via email and wait for response** action.

## How to connect to SurveyMonkey on Workato
The SurveyMonkey connector uses [OAuth2 authentication](https://developer.surveymonkey.com/api/v3/#authentication) to authenticate with SurveyMonkey.
